Lecture Notes On Operating Systems Course
=========================================

Here are some unfinished notes on operating systems course
I've taught in [SPbSU ITMO](http://www.ifmo.ru/).
Everything except this README is in russian language.

Internet had already covered most of topics present in course.
I wrote only parts about base topics, which didn't have good sources in russian.

Topics covered here:

* Introduction to Software Licenses (It propably has tons of errors, I'm not an expert at this)
* ABI and Linking

Topics that should be covered, but I'm too lazy:

* Device mapper, RAIDs.
* File systems.
